## Abstract
  Spacestagram is a Frontend Developer Intern challenge brought to you by NASA's Astronomy Photo of the Day API and Shopify. The theme of the challenge was inspired by Shopify's mission to Make Commerce Better for Everyone, including whole entire universe. The application fetches image and description data from NASA's API, and a user can both like and unlike a photo, as well as click on an image to view its description.
 
  The application was built with React v17.0.2 and React Router v6.2.1.
